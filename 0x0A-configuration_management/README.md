0x0A. Configuration management

Configuration management refers to the practice of managing and controlling changes to software, hardware, or system configurations in an organized and systematic manner. It involves keeping track of the configuration items (CIs), which are the components of a system, and managing their versions, relationships, and attributes throughout their lifecycle.

Configuration management is an essential discipline in software development, systems engineering, and IT operations to ensure that systems are properly configured, maintained, and updated. It involves documenting and controlling changes to configuration items, establishing baselines or reference points for configurations, and tracking and auditing changes to ensure consistency, reliability, and security.

Configuration management typically involves the following key activities:

1. Configuration Identification: Identifying and defining the configuration items (CIs) that make up a system, and assigning unique identifiers to them.

2. Configuration Control: Establishing a change management process to control and track changes to configurations, including requests for changes, evaluation of changes, approval or rejection of changes, and implementation of approved changes.

3. Configuration Status Accounting: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of the current status of each configuration item, including its version, status, and relationship with other CIs.

4. Configuration Verification and Audit: Conducting periodic reviews and audits to verify that configurations are compliant with established baselines, standards, and policies, and identifying and resolving discrepancies.

5. Configuration Documentation: Creating and maintaining documentation that describes the configuration items, their relationships, and their attributes, including technical specifications, user manuals, and configuration guides.

6. Configuration Baseline Management: Establishing and managing baselines, which are reference points for configurations that are used as a basis for comparison and change control.

Configuration management helps organizations achieve better control, traceability, and repeatability in managing complex systems, and enables effective collaboration among development, operations, and other stakeholders. It helps prevent configuration drift, reduce risks associated with unauthorized changes, and improve the overall quality and stability of systems.
