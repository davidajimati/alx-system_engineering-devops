### Background Context
The web infrastructure(web server) is already serving web pages via Nginx that I installed in the web stack project.
While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. 
In this project I will add this piece to my infrastructure, plug it to Nginx and make it serve the Airbnb clone project.

This Project focuses on implementing `Application server` for the `AirBnB clone` project.
I covered the follwing:
- WSGI
- Flask
- uWSGI
- uwsgi
- Gunicorn
- Apllication server
